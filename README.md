# Gaussian-Mixture-Model
Gaussian Mixture Model is a distributed based model. GMM assumes that there are a certain number of gaussian distribution and each of these distributions represent a cluster. Hence, a gaussian mixture model tends to group the data point's belonging to a single distribution together. It is a probablistic model. Mean and variance value of each gaussian is assigned through a technique called Expectation - Maximization. EM is a statistical algorithm for finding the right model parameter. GMM takes into account the mean as well as the variance of the data. On the othe hand K-means only considers the mean. da
